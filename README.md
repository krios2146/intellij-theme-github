## Overview

<!-- Plugin description -->

This theme is my own interpretation of how a GitHub theme should look.  
It's a mix of one of the [Gerry Themes](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18922-gerry-themes) and GitHub colors that I like the most.

Important notes about CatHub Theme:
 - It's very dark and therefore high contrast
 - Mainly focusing on styling new Intellij IDEA UI
 - May contain various bugs, because initially was made for personal use
